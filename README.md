    dataset/:                           the folder for orignal data.
    dataloader/:                        the folder for data loader.
    common/:                            the folder for basic functions.
    models/:                            the folder for networks (different versions).
    train_xx.py:                        the python code for networks' training.

## Environment
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
* PyTorch >= 1.3.0
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* sklearn
* pickle
* tqdm


## Datasets

- We employed our proprietary sEMG-visual dataset to train our network architecture. 
- We anticipate making this dataset publicly available through an open-source release in the near future.
